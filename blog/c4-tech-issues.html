    <h1>A Big 10 Problem Issue in the Tech Industry</h1>
    <h2>DBC Week 4, Challenge #8</h2>

  <section>

    <p>The assignment was to identify a problem facing the tech industry, explain
      why it is a problem and to hypothesize a possible solution. My first thoughts
      were that I was going to be looking into things like data management, network
      strains and capabilities, the loss of work force with the retirement of baby
      boomers, and the fact that technologies are changing so quickly that by the time
      you implement a new one on Monday it is obsolete before the weekend is upon you.
      What I did't think I was going to be reading about was customer service.
    </p>

    <p>Maybe it's because I still barely have my feet in the pool of the tech world,
      but I never thought customer service played such a large role in the industry.
      Yet after reading about how poor customer service can have such a large effect
      upon the tech industry I am realizing the importantance of its role. The
      fact is that the technology world is implementing software and devices to a
      customer base that sees the advantages of certain products and services but
      doesn't exactly understand the how they are built or how they work. Sure once
      someone buys a device or installs some software they can go and read a user
      manual, but that only gets you so far. What happens when something breaks? What
      happens you just can't get it to work? What happens when you discover that the
      tech product or service you paid for is not functioning in the way you asked
      for it to be?
    </p>

    <p>So here is where customer service comes in to play. Customer service can range
      from the service rep you call to figure out why your internet connection is not
      working to the web designers for the firm that has built your new website. The
      difficulty for the customer in the situation where they have to contact an IT
      professional, is the ability to express themselves, their needs and wants, using
      the vocabulary that the tech person needs to identify the problems. It goes
      both ways in the situation, where the IT professional is limited in their ability
      to tend to the needs of the customer because of that same difficulty in clearly
      expressing their ideas, needs and wants. Really it comes down to symantics. The
      customer and the tech industry need to be able to communicate with a singular
      language. Unless each side is using the same language to represent their ideas
      those ideas are not going to be translated from one side to the other and
      ultimately into the product that's being built.
    </p>

    <p>A bigger problem arrises when the relstionship between the customer and the IT
      professional becomes strained because of this rift in communication. The customer
      can not express themselves in a way that the IT rep can easily understand, so
      the product that they design for the client is not what the customer thought
      they were going to get or the help that they receive doesn't solve their problem.
      Unless a suitable solution is found, this communication rift starts a back and
      forth between the customer and the tech, that more often than not creates
      frustration on both sides and ultimately ends in the customer walking away from
      that tech service or product with a bad taste in their mouth.
    </p>

    <p>So the question becomes how to break this rift in communication so that the
      ideas of the customer can be clearly expressed and the tech products created
      can properly reflect what the cutomer wants to receive?
    <p>

    <p>To me the answer to the above comes with improving communication by cultivating
      the relationship between the customer and the IT world. The wrinkle in the plan
      is that this answer is one that takes time. It has to start with the IT customer
      service actively listening to what the client has to say and finding a way to
      empathize with them. The tech has to be able to think from the perspecive of
      their client in order to see what it is that they want. Then the back and forth
      can become one of collaboration and education as opposed to one of
      frustration and misunderstanding. The more that the tech can go back to the
      customer and help them mold the working product within the capabilities of the
      technologies IT is using, the more cost effectively the product will be built
      and the happier the customer will be with that product. The more that the tech
      works with the customer the more educated the customer becomes and the
      easier it is to work together to build something that suits the customer as well
      as possible. This could be accomplished through bringing the customer into your
      pseudocoding process. The customer would then have the ability to be a part of
      the design in a non technical but specific way by identifying what they want and
      what they want to have happen. The customer doesn't need to know how a thing
      gets done within the code, but they need have a hand in directing what the end
      product is what it is going to look like. Including the customer in the design
      process in such an integral will not only teach them some of the language they
      need to express themselves more clearly to the tech, but also empower them to
      speak up about problems they see and changes that need to take place from their
      perspective. The comfort that comes from being a part of the process will
      ultimately give the customer more of an ability to step in and say, "No, that's
      now what I want, we need to change it in such and such a way". Along the line,
      the unseen by-product of this collaboration is customer loyalty. Once that
      relationship is built and the customer sees that a tech firm is actively working
      with them and willing to customize a product for them, that firm is the one they
      are going to go back to again and again.
    </p>

    <p>No matter how fantasitic your product is, how small, how fast, how fashionable,
      how functional, if the support that comes behind it is less than the customer
      wants, that customer will seize to be a customer. In the restaurant industry
      there is an old saying that I learned very early on which I think can be related
      to any situation of customer service: a customer is more likely to come back to
      a restaurant with bad food and fantastic service than they are to a restaurant
      with fantastic food and shitty service. What it means is that the product is only
      a part of it, the experience is really what people walk away with. The better
      the experience, the more likely the customer is to return and tell people about
      your product.
    </p>

    <p>In the end tech products and services are created and designed for people
      who have at best a limited tech background. The more that the tech
      industry can identify that fact and relate to their customer base in a way that
      makes the customer comfortable enough to talk about concepts they are not well
      schooled in, the better the product they are going to produce. The more that the
      tech industry is willing to mold their products to the responses of the customer
      base, the more the customer base is going to want to use those products.
