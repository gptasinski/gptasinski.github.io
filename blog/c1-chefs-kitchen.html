    <h2>DBC Week 1, Challenge #12</h2>
    <h4>April 30, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      I'll just start by saying that I am presently blowing out the bottom
      of my time box here. I was 45 minutes into the video before I remembered
      that I was trying to keep my time in check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on the video from the challenge I'm coming away with the feeling
      that the DBC experience is a learning experience for everyone all around.
      Not that I had a poor impression of DBC before watching this video, but
      I think I'm coming out of it with a more positive impression. There
      appears to be a nurturing feeling to the environment as well as a strong
      sense of community. The idea that DBC is still an experiment is something
      that stuck in my head. I like the idea that I am part of the experiment
      to learn how to teach in a better way. I am excited to be in an environment
      that is guided and mentored by skilled teachers who are not just going
      to be teaching items from a syllibus into my head. There is
      something empowering in taking control of what I am going to get out of
      my education. I see myself engaging with this culture head on. I want to
      get in there and try things out, make mistakes and learn from them. I
      want to get to the point where the fear of not knowing enough disappears
      and I can get on with learning as much as I can, and at the same time be
      able to help the others who are working along with me.
    </p>
    <p>
       After watching the majority of the Fireside Chat I can't really say
       that my expectations for DBC have changed. I might be more apt to say
       that my expectations for myself have changed. I have spent most of my
       academic career in the 'restaurant table' mindset. Options were given,
       the work was done, and I tried my hardest to thrive. I am stepping
       outside of my comfort zone having to mold my own learning path, and I
       like that. The idea that there's no one concrete text for what I will
       be learning and that I have to do a lot of research and experiment
       on my own intrigues me. As a person who has been taught that education
       never ends, that there is always a chance or reason to perfect and
       advance what you do, I like the idea that what DBC is trying to do is
       'put me on the track to becomming a good developer'. They are going to
       start with the basis of a massive skillset, and it is up to me and my
       community for all of us to get through it, and to better ourselves
       through doing it. It is a challenge that I am eager to take on, although
       I am a touch nervous about it as well. With all new experiences there's
       always a bit of nervousness, but as long as I can get back up and
       running after being knocked on my ass the first time, I'll fall right
       in line. At least that's the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now back to feeding my brain.
