    <h1>A Concrete Sequential Thinker</h1>
    <h2>DBC Week 3, Challenge 8</h2>

  <section>

    <p>As the title of this blog post states, I am a Concrete Sequential Thinker. I
      like things to be in order and I like to follow a sequence of tasks. I like to
      know the facts about what I am doing, know what my end goal is and work to get
      there step by step. I strive with structure and predictability and generally
      avoid group work. These are all things that I have felt over the long years of
      education but I have never really thought about them or known that there's a
      definable group of people who think like me. I thought we were all just
      introverts that liked to work on our own and not really belong to any group.
    </p>

    <p>Recently having entered the program at Dev Bootcamp I have been learning more
      about how to learn than I ever have before. The idea that my habits fall into a
      category of similar thinkers is filling my head with ideas of how I can now use
      that information to make the most out of my experience out of DBC. The first thing I plan to do is keep up on my what challenges I have ahead of me, make
      a plan of how I am going to attack it and then get to work. What has occurred
      to me is that I am going to feel a lot better about the week's work if, as the
      first thing I do, I sit down and read through all the README files for all of
      the challenges in addition to the week's README. Knowing exactly what the tasks
      are that I am supposed to complete is going to help me plan immensely. I can take
      the sequence of challenges that have been put forth and manage to put them into
      a sequence for what is best for me. I am also thinking that I need to develop a
      routine of sorts for how I am going to work. The routine could involve things
      ranging from checking my Twitter account for DBC related posts to taking the time
      to complete the long list of updates and changes I want to make to my website.
      I do believe that having a structure such as that is going to help keep me on
      track as well as alleviating the fear that I am falling behing and not digesting
      the material well enough. I am going to have to schedule some time in or
      throughout the day shut out the outside world for a minute and to check back in
      with myself. Whether that means using the mid-day break to take a long walk and
      clear my head, or putting on headphones to shut out the distractions of the
      world as large. It may be just a minute to shut down the fast pace of our
      curriculum and find out where I stand in my plan, but the more comforatble I feel
      with my plans, the less stressed I will be, and I will be able to put forth much better work.
    </p>

    <p>The biggest challenge so far dealing with the avalanche of this material is
      distraction management. My email dings like the seconds tick on a clock and I
      get sidetracked looking up some tangential concept that I come across while
      working. My daughter is asking me what I am doing nearly as much as my email is
      dinging, the phone is ringing, delivery people are ringing my doorbell, and the
      dogs aroung my house have all been barking at each other for the past two hours.
      Non f@#&$^g stop, no joke. I am having to learn to shut things out, whether it
      is with headphones or taking time to meditate before trying to work. On the other
      hand, I know that I am capable of extreme amounts of focus, and I have no know
      where to draw the line between focusing on what I have to do and being a part of
      my family as well as society. I still need to be a father, I still need to do
      the dishes, and I'm glad no one's here as I write, because I surely need a
      shower.
    </p>

    <p>After reading up on all my Gregorc Thinking style as well as my VARK Learning
      Style, I do believe that my struggle with distraction management is connected in
      some degree to the way I think and learn. From here on I plan on setting a daily
      schedule and sticking to it. I am going to turn off email notifiers, phone
      ringers, and I am going to wear headphone while I work. But I am going to make
      sure that they go back on when I am done. I am going to set a work environment,
      see how it works and change it again if it doesn't. The next few weeks are going
      to be trial and error, test and adapt, get frustrated and mellow out again.
      Whoever thought learning to code was going to be an emotional and temperamental
      roller coaster. Guess I picked the wrong day to stop sniffing glue!!!
    </p>

    <p>As I stated in my second blog post, I have been in what I consider to be the
      rut of the restaurant mindest. Sure I excelled in school with that mindset, but
      the point is that I never pushed the envelope. I never made myself work harder
      than I was really asked to. I drank the cup that they served me without asking
      what it was or if I could have more when I liked it. Well as much as I know
      that structure will help me in many ways I have to test out what a
      non-structured setting can do for me. There have to be points where I set
      aside the schedule and the routine to step out of my comfort zone, if for
      nothing more than to see where it might lead me. I will start embracing the
      group work that I normally avoid, I will stop looking for the sole "right" answer that earned me praise in the past (and chastising myself for not
      attaining it), and I will stop shunning disarray. Shit, it may turn out that
      these changes may make no difference, they may make my ability to learn, grow
      and develop worse, but I just might stumble across cold fusion. Either way I
      will never know without trying. The worse that's going to happen is that I'm
      going to fall on my ass, but what's another scrape? I guess the point in the
      end is that an open mind allows a whole lot more to enter it than a closed one.
