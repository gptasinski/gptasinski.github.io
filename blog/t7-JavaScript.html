      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting here trying to think about a fundamental
        difference between Ruby and JavaScript the first thing that comes to mind is
        the error message. Or the lack thereof if you want to look at it that way.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a beginner to coding there have been many hurdles
        to pass and much frstration to overcome. I have found that one of the biggest
        sources of my frustration in learning something completely new is dealing with
        mistakes and errors. As a kid I was taught that mistakes are not a
        problem, that they should even be looked at as good because they are a
        learning tool. How are you going to learn how to do something right, if you
        don't ever know what it is like to do that thing wrong? Making a mistake is
        not something to be looked down upon, because it's what you do with, or on
        account of the mistake, that really the important thing. Great and
        magnifecent things have come form mistakes throughout history, and will
        continue to do so.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is that in order to grow from our mistakes,
        we have to have some information about those mistakes. What caused them? Where
        did they happen? What else could have been done? Why is that something else
        better? Conveniently both Ruby and Jacvascript give us information about our
        errors in the form of messages when they encounter some error in our script.
        However what those messges that each language sends is a fundamental
        difference between the two languages.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some sense Ruby is the good cop in this situation.
        Error messages in Ruby tend to give you a ton of information. The file name is
        given. The line number the error occurs on is given. The type of error is
        given. There is even an arrow pointing to the point of error included in the
        message. Once one learns how to read through a Ruby error message, fixing the
        problem is not all that big of an issue. You can go to the file called for,
        find the line mentioned, pinpoint where the error is happening, find the type
        of error that is occurring and go look up how to fix it. Maybe the task of
        actually making the code run will prove to be difficult, but Ruby will tell
        you everything you need to know to go about fixing it outside of telling you
        how to fix it.
       </p>

       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course if there's a good cop there has to be a
        bad cop. JavaScript is wearing the bad cop costume in this context. JavaScript
        tells you that there is an error and pretty much leaves it at that. JS gives
        you information about the error, but it's not as informative. Sure the line
        and file location are there, but outside of a one line message, there's not
        much more to it than that. JS tells you that it can't recognize something, or
        it can't take some action on undefined, or that some value is not defined. The
        issue is that all three of these messages can come about because of a
        misplaced comma or semi-colon that occurred somewhere else than the line
        being mentioned in the error message. JS error messages don't throw that
        clear and concise message as to what happened, where it happened and why
        it is happening.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that one of the languages is
        better than the other, or that someone should choose to use one language over
        the other because of the difference of how they treat errors. The point is
        that if you are one of those beginners, such as myself who are really and
        truely breaking into the world of coding for the first time, you need to be
        aware of the fact that if although JS doesn't give you the information that
        Ruby does about your error there's no reason to pull your hair trying to
        figure it out. What I have learned over the past week is that JS makes you
        work for it. You have to go back up and play around with the code. Maybe you
        forgot a comma and that's why your function is reading as not defined. Maybe
        you forgot one of the ever present semi-colons somewhere and two lines are
        being read as wone. JS makes you go back and sift through your stucture
        and sytax to see what is really going on, almost forcing you through a
        learning experience that is a little more active than reading. As long as you
        can employ the patience to work back through the file and check all your
        points of syntax, any error can be overcome.
