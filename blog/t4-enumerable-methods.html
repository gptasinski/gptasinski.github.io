    <h1>Map It!</h1>

    <p>So you want to know about the enumerable map method, eh? Well, first let's talk
      about what an enumerable is. And please, if at any point you are reading this and
      you feel that I, well, could use some help, just stop reading. Go ahead and click
      the Contact link up above, send me an email and tell me what you think. Please.
    </p>

    <p>So then, I've been looking at it like this:<br />
      An enumerable is a method that can count across a list of elements. It can take
      that list and do something to each element in turn. By the way, the enumerator
      is the thing that you are counting across, yup, the array, the hash or the range.
      These enumerables work similarly to a loop, but there's not the risk of the loop
      spiraling out of control and running on forever. The enumerable is going to
      take some action on each element once, or in the case of some methods it will
      take the action only as many times as you tell it to. There's a bunch of these
      enumerables and although they all act in a similar fashion they all have a
      specific job that they do. And please, focus, we're only going to talk about
      the enumerable method map here.
    </p>

    <p>Let's look at it with an example, so that all these words that sound so
      similar don't look like the same thing.
    </p>

    <p>So there's an enumerable method called map. Now what map does is return an array
      containing the results of running a block of code once for every element in the
      enumerator. I know that didn't help, but think of this:
    </p>

    <p>You just got a new puppy, and he's so damn cute. But you took him to the dog
      park, he got in a scuffle and now has a nasty infection. You went to the vet and
      got antibiotics for him. The bitch of it all it is that now you have to give the
      puppy the meds every three hours and you have trouble remembering things. Good
      thing you have started programming! You now have the tools to keep track of the times that you have to give him the meds.
    </p>

    <p>First thing you do is write down all the hours when you are going to give the
      puppy his meds in a simple array:
    </p>

    <p><code>med_times = [9, 12, 3, 6, 9, 12, 3, 6]</code></p>

    <p>So there you have the med schedule stored in a simple array (an enumerator).
      But what good is that you say? Well it's 2:30 and you can't remember what the next med time is. But you know that you have an enumerable method called map that you can call on the array. If you call the method on your array without a
      block of code it will return an enumerator. So you open your lap top, find the Ruby file you stored the array in and type "p med_times.map" (if you puts or
      print, well you'll get a big old number that looks like the number on a bar
      code):
    </p>

    <p><code>p med_times.map    #=> Enumerator:[9, 12, 3, 6, 9, 12, 3, 6]</code></p>
    <p>You just accessed your list, and can rest assured your pup will get his meds
      at the right time. What you just did, in the simplest terms, was tell your
      array to output a "map" of the elements in the array. Because you didn't supply
      map with a specific action to take on each element, the array was returned.
    <p>

    <p>Turns out you woke up and gave him meds at 8, and now you need to change
      all the times in your list. No problem! This is what map was made for. Remember?
      If you call it with a code block, it will do something to each element of the
      list. You need to subtract 1 from each of the elements in the list. Map it!
    </p>
    <p><code>p med_times.map { |i| i - 1 }   #=> [8, 11, 2, 5, 8, 11, 2, 5]</code></p>

    <p>You just told your list, through the method map, to take every element, pick
      it up, and subtract one from it. The bonus happens to be that map is going
      to take the result of subtracting one from each time in the list and return it in a new list. The beauty of map is that it doesn't change the original array, it returns a new one.
    <p>

    <p>Now, you get home from the market and your roommate accuses you of not having
      given the pup the meds all day. You feel insulted and decide to let map talk
      for you! Check it out:</p>
    <p><code>med_times.map { |i| puts "Chico got his meds at #{i}" }  #=><br />
      "Chico got his meds at 9"<br />
      "Chico got his meds at 12"<br />
      "Chico got his meds at 3"<br />
      "Chico got his meds at 6"<br />
      "Chico got his meds at 9"<br />
      "Chico got his meds at 12"<br />
      "Chico got his meds at 3"<br />
      "Chico got his meds at 6"</code></p>

      <p>How 'bout that, eh?</p>

      <p>That part in between the curly brackets is the code block. What you did was
        take that your original array med_times and used map to tell it to take
        every element and place it in the sentence provided. Map then outputs the
        sentence in the code block with the times from the list placed into it. Now
        your roomate can see that you are on top of things.
      </p>

      <p>This is just the start, just a quick tease into the powers of map and what
        an enumerable method can do. Once you dive into the Ruby Documentation you will
        find that there are other enumerable methods that you can use to keep track
        of your various schedules and wow your friends with. Just remember some
        important things. You have to call the enumerable with a block to get it to
        do something, and keep in mind it is going to do that something to every
        element, not just a few. If you don't give the block you are going to get
        back some big number, unless you "p" it. You will not change the original
        enumerator with map unless you add an "!", but that changes with some
        methods. Do yourself a favor and go read the documentation:
