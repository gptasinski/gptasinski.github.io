  <section>

    <p>I recently stopped working in the restaurant industry, recently retired from
      the restaurant industry as I like to put it, after a twenty year plus stretch.
      I find it hard to explain the values I hold myself to without drawing examples
      from the life experiences I gained while working as a cook, a waiter and a
      bartender. So, well, indulge me for a minute.
    </p>

    <p>One of the first things I was told when I entered the fast paced and hot
      tempered work place of the service industry was that if you encounter a
      problem, try and fix it yourself before asking for help. I may have been told
      this merely to be kept out of other people's hair, but it quickly became a
      mantra that I stuck to every day that I tied an apron on, and I still find
      myself sticking with as I work my way through the basics of programming.
      Being forced to rely on myself before others has been a tool that has
      had a domino effect on instilling other traits and values into my life as
      each day ticks by.
    </p>

    <p>Sure, there are always points where you have to get help because moving
      forward is impossible without an outside influence, but in those times where
      you can make strides based on your own knowledge, skills and ideas the
      outcome and benefits are so much more rewarding. When one achieves some
      feat or overcomes some obstacle on their own, it leads to a sense of
      confidence, personal development, knowledge, and independence. Self-reliance
      is a building block for many other values in life that I hold myself to, and
      pushed me to discover skills and traits in myself I would have never known
      existed if I had asked for help in the first place. Without the ability to be
      self-reliant I don't think I would be here writing a blog for an assigment in
      the seventh week of a course on a topic I knew virtually nothing about two
      months ago. Accomplishing a feat or overcoming an obstacle by oneself provides
      the knowledge that one can do something once thought impossible, provides the
      confidence to forge ahead and try another unfamiliar and challenging thing,
      and teaches one to think on their feat to succeed as opposed to pushing away
      things that seem to be outside of their abilities.
    </p>

    <p>I honestly can't remember the last time that someone asked me directly
      for my advice. Maybe that's on account of the fact that the people who
      know me, know me well enough to know what my answer will be: just go and try
      it for Christ's sake. If you are worried or afraid about doing something, you
      really only have to choices; either act or don't act. You are never going to
      get anywhere unless you actively have experiences in the first place. Those
      experiences are going to include failure and success. Those experiences are
      going to include a learning curve that may or may not lead to something.
      And those experiences are going to lead to other people looking at you or
      thinking about you in some way or another. Go out and prove something to
      yourself despite the outcome. Go and see what you can do despite what other
      people think. You might just learn something.
    </p>

    <p>I think that the value of self-reliance plays an important role in the skill
      of dealing with the stereotype threat in life. As large of an importance that
      I place upon being self reliant I also think knowing your limits is of great
      importance. Go out there and act upon something and if you need help ask for
      it. There's nothing shameful in saying 'I can't do this by myself, can you
      help me through it'. Whether or not the person you ask for help thinks poorly
      of you should be of no consequence, as long as they are actively trying to
      help. Hell, ask advice from more than one person, get as much as you help
      as you can when you need help. But take it and make it your own. Be self
      reliant enough to know when the help or advice you get is really worth
      putting into action or practice.
