    <h1>Feedback Me Seymore! Feedback Me!</h1>

  <section>

    <p>I'll be as honest as possible to start this off. The whole idea of pairing
      and giving feedback made me cringe when I first started my learning adventure
      with Dev Bootcamp. I have always preferred to work alone, with the thought that
      peer influence on my work would serve only to stifle my creativity and
      efficiency. As for feedback, I was naive enough to think that the only feedback
      I could make use of was from someone in a teaching position and not from someone
      who was learning alongside me.
    </p>

    <p>I stand corrected.</p>

    <p>At the start of Phase 0 I have to say that pairing with someone to solve a
      challenge made my palms sweat. I got nervous about showcasing not what I knew
      but reavealing what I didn't know. The thought of dragging someone down
      because of my (now lessening) ignorance of coding and my lack of experience was
      at the forefront of my mind. Yet, within the first few minutes of my first
      pairing, the negative thoughts and feelings of apprehension lessened as quickly
      as they grew. Those sessions in Week 1 really opened my eyes to the fact that we
      are all in the same boat, and the fact that if I didn't expose my weaknesses how
      would I ever turn them into strengths?
    </p>

    <p>Working with someone else to get to a working solution on a challenge wasn't
      nearly as dificult as I has imagined it to be. I had foreseen a struggle between
      the different ideas of how to approach the problem and how to go about solving
      it. I had also foreseen the difficulty of getting an idea across to my pair so
      that we could be on the same page to actually work together. As it turned out,
      once again, I couldn't have been more wrong. Following the steps of doing a
      check-in and taking at least a few minutes to get to know each other on a
      personal level helped to dispell those thoughts. That check in process, then and
      now, has opened up a door to smooth communication that is so essential to
      working with someone else on anything. Sure there are always hiccups along the
      way, but without a clear avenue of expression, there's no way to get one's
      ideas across to get anything done. I think that each time I pair with someone
      on a challenge the easier it becomes, the more comfortable I get with the
      process and the more I enjoy it.
    </p>

    <p>I've discovered that solving a challenge with a pair alleviates a lot of the
      stress and frustration that can arrise when I work alone. Having another brain
      working on the same problem and another set of eyes to look at that problem
      means that more often than not there's always going to be a plan B while
      working. It's too easy for me to get stuck on one train of thought and then get
      Ã¼ber frustrated and pissed off when my train of thought just can't seem to get
      down the damn tracks, much less arrive at the next station. The reward for me
      is having someone else along for the ride to tell me to switch tracks when
      things aren't working or to keep chugging along when we are actually running
      along smoothly. As long as the communication is open and clear and both sides
      of the pair are willing to let the other's ideas drive the work, I think that
      pairing on a challenge is a great benefit. On the other hand great frustration
      arrises from the pairing if there's not that sense of open communication
      or a willingness to set one's own ideas aside to follow what their pair thinks
      is better.
    </p>

    <p>As open as the communication may be, there is always that silent and underlying
      beast of personal feelings. The pair may seem to be working well with each
      other and the work may be progressing in a positive manner, but there's still a
      chance that one side or the other isn't comfortable with something. Maybe one
      side feels that their pair is not allowing them to contribute. Maybe they feel
      disrespected or slighted and that their ideas are being cast aside. Maybe one
      side is working much faster than the other, and one side of the pair is watching
      concepts fly by without really grasping them. Most of the time, if the work is
      progressing well, but these other feelings exist, I think that most people
      would rather swallow these feelings in order to just get the work done and be
      able to walk away from the situation then to address them on the spot and cause
      a disruption in work flow. Being forced to give feedback, as well as receive it,
      allows us to express ourselves comfortably and ultimately improve how we work
      with each other.
      </p>

      <p>I like to think about feedback as game film for an athlete. It allows one to
        see their performance from an honest outside perspective after the fact. I
        think that getting criticism in the moment, no matter how positive, is too
        disruptive to be of any use. It works a whole lot better to have one's mind
        free from working on a challenge to think about how each side worked on that
        challenge. I also find it easier to give the criticism after the fact. Giving
        feedback has been hard, I will have to admit. Sometimes I am so impressed with
        the person I worked with that I feel like I have to really stretch to
        come up with some constructive criticism. Sometimes I feel like I have too
        much to say and worry about turning the feedback into negative thing. I
        don't want the feedback I give to look like I am nit-picking, but without
        being specific about actions and emotions occurring in the pairing, what's
        the point of the feedback in the first place?
      </p>

      <p>On one hand when I read the feedback that people gave me it made me feel
        really good. There were a lot of places where I thought I was struggling and
        my pairs thought I was doing well. It was as if I was looking at my game film
        and saw myself running fast where I thought I was barely walking. On
        the other hand, I read through the feedback, and wished that people had taken
        off the kid gloves before they wrote. To me the purpose of the feedback is
        not to be nice and blow smoke up each other's asses, but to be honest about
        how the actions, demeanor and communication of the other person affected one's
        work. I think that for the most part there's a fear that people have about
        hurting each other's feelings that impedes their ability to say something
        like, "Hey, what you did offended me so much that I couldn't be productive".
        As much as I want more constructive criticism about my weak points, I think
        that what I have received has helped me to see how my weaknesses can effect
        others and not just myself.
      </p>

      <p>I'm walking away from the feedback with the idea that it is like a to-do
        list. A to-improve list if you will. I plan on reviewing the feedback before
        going into another pairing to try and ficus on the criticisms that people gave
        me in order to try not to repeat them again. As much as I cringed from the
        ideas of pairing and feedback in the beginning, I am really glad that we have
        this whole system. At this point I am finding that I want to pair more often
        than I do because I find it so helpful to learn from others as well as to
        teach others. I think that I learn a whole lot more working with someone else
        than I do by myself, because of the ability to bounce ideas off each other,
        the having a co-pilot when exploring concepts, and ultimately receiving the
        feedback on how my pair thought I performed. Although I don't necessarily
        believe that the feedback is affecting my learning of the material, it is
        helping me to learn how to better work with others and better understand how
        I work.
