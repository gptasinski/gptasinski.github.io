    <h1>Version Control, Git and GitHub</h1>
    <h2>DBC Week 1 Challenge #11</h2>
    <h4>April 30, 2015</h4>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>
      I tried to get a jumpstart on my work for DBC Phase 0 last week by setting
      up Git and my GitHub account, but, well, it didn't go so well. I thought
      they were one and the same. I set up the my username on GitHub, thought
      that meant I had Git, and was proud of myself. Then I started going through
      the challenges on Monday, and my pride deflated. You'll be happy to know
      that my little balloon of pride is filling back up. I think I've got it
      together,or separated actually, now, since I've been using it the past
      few days to complete the challenges for Week 1 Curriculum.
    </p>
    <p>
        Warning: after you read this, go look these things up. I've been
        working with Git and GitHub for about four days now, and although I've
        made it work and feel confident with it... eh, well, I've been wrong
        plenty of times before. If you go research and find out I'm as wrong
        as I hoped I wouldn't be, let me in on it. We can tweet about it!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What are the benefit's of Version Control?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, first off let's talk about what version control is. Version
        Control really is just a fancy way of saying a method of keeping track
        of all the versions you're making to to something you are working on.
        With version control you have the ability to go back in time and look
        at each version of your work that you have changed. Imagine you have a
        timline of whatever project it is you are working on. What version
        control allows you to do is make a stamp on that timeline for every
        change (edit, subtrction, addition) that takes place on your project.
        Then through the 'magic' of Git and GitHub you can go back to those
        stamps you placed on the timeline to see what you changed, see who
        may have changed it (in case it wasn't you), and when it changed. With
        Git and GitHub you also have the ability to make comments on your
        changes, just to keep you aware of why some changes on that stamp may
        have been made. The benefit to this is that if you make a change to
        your project that, say 'gummed up the works', you can go back to the
        version (stamp) before it and work from there, the project does not
        hae to be scrapped and you do not have to start over form the beginning.
        The other major benefit to version conrol is that it makes group work
        much more fluid. Each team member can get a copy of the project, do
        their work on it and save it. The work they did can be reviewed before
        it is all merged together, and there's no chance that team members are
        going to be changing someone elses's chages before they know about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How does Git help you keep track of changes?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Git helps you keep track of changes by tracking what's going on with
        your project on your computer. Git is software that you download on your
        computer, you don't need an Internet connection to use it. Once you have
        a directory that is git initialized, as you work on your project you can
        go back to your terminal and check to see where it is in terms of changes.
        By using the command 'git status' you can find out if your file has changed,
        how many changes have been made, if the file is tracked and ready to be
        saved, or if he file has already been saved (called commit for git). You
        can delete changes or even delete the changed files without affecting the
        original.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why store your work on GitHub</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well first off we need to know what GitHub is. GitHub works just like git,
        but instead of living in your computer, it lives on the Internet. You can
        take all the timeline stamps of your project that you have made and store
        them on GitHub almost like a cloud, yet with the big difference that other
        people can access your project. GitHub is like the offspring of a social
        networking site and cloud storage. You can store your work there and allow
        other people to see it, pull it into their own computer, edit it, and then
        they can load those changes back onto GitHub. It makes a lot of sense to
        store your projects on GitHub because you it can be collaborated upon (and
        you can collaborate on other people's projects). By storing your work on
        GitHub you also allow yourself the ability to access it from multiple places.
        Have an idea about your project while at Grandma's for Easter, on vacation
        in Brussels, or in some coffee shop on the other side out town without
        your Mac? As long as you there's a computer to use and an Internet connection
        you can access that project. Finally GitHubis a good idea for storage as a
        kind of a system of checks and balances. You can make sure that there are
        essentailly two copies of your working master, one in a git file on your
        computer, one on GitHub. Your computer is destroyed in a freak accident,
        you still have the project. You can also make sure that the master copy
        on GitHub is the same master copy on your computer. That way you are not
        wasting time fixing something, that may have already been fixed and posted
        by someone else.
        </p>
        <p>
        So, that may have been lengthy and long winded, but hey, I'm a Chicagoan.
        Hopefully this makes some sense out of git and GitHub and Version Control,
        and we can all go on to collaborate together on massive projects that
        will feed, pacify and heal the world. See you then!
