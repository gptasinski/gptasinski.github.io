      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are as new to programming as I am, you may
        have experienced what I like torefer to as the sweat reaction that comes from
        encountering terms and concepts that seem foreign or a bit high-brow. C'mon
        admit it, you've been there. When seeing a phrase like 'create an algorithm'
        my heart rate and blood pressure increase, my palms get a little slick and I
        think to myself 'how the hell do I do that? I studied German not Math!'
        However, after taking a minute to think, it becomes clear that algorithm is
        just a fifty-cent word for a list of procedures. I have been creating and
        using them with relative ease for the past few weeks. Once settled down I can
        get to work and try to actually learn something.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try this one on for size. Blocks! Procs! Lambdas!
        Blocks and Procs and Lambdas, oh my! Is your heart beating a little faster?
        Are you warmer than you were before reading that last line? Have you run for a
        paper towel to blot your palms? Well I hope not, I wasn't trying to frighten
        you.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm like to take a minute of your time to break these
        three terms down into their basic parts: what they are and how they work.
        Hopefully by the time you finish reading this these terms will become more
        like a friendly face you are happy to recognize rather than a dude lurking in
        the shadows with his hood up on a hot night, just staring at you.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it goes, short and sweet with examples to follow.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A block is simply a piece of code that can be
        executed. The block is the code contained between the <b>'{ }'</b>, or bound
        by the <b>'do'</b> and <b>'end'</b>. You might recognize it from such syntax
        as:</br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;vegetables = ["asparagus", "green beans", "broccoli"]</code></li>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;vegetables.each <b>do</b> |item|</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "I love to eat #{item}!"</code></li>
            </ul>
          <li><b><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;end</b></code></li>

            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat asparagus!</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat green beans!</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat broccoli!</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        or:</br>
          <ul>
            <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;vegetables.each <b>{</b> |item| puts "I love to eat #{item}!"<b>}</b></code><li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat asparagus!</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat green beans!</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat broccoli!</code></li>
            </ul>
          </ul></br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple enough right? All that's going on is that the
        method 'each' grabs each vegetable in the array of vegetables, the block takes
        control of the action and acts on a vegtable, and finally block gives the
        control back to 'each' until every vegetable has been dealt with. The issue is
        that the block is not an object, it can't saved to a variable and be reused.
        If you wanted to use this same block again it has to be typed out in the code
        each time you need it.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the block in the above example, you
        realize that you like to eat many other foods than just what is in the
        vegetable array. If the block from above (I love to eat #{item}!) could be
        saved as a variable, you then could call it as an argument to a method and use
        it on other arrays, say fruit, meats or nuts.Now, young Rubyist, meet the proc.
        In the simplest of terms a proc is a saved block. Proc is its own class, so
        when you create a new proc, you are creating an object. Check it out:</br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To define a proc set a variable equal to
        <b>Proc.new</b> followed by the block to be saved:</br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;food_message = <b>Proc.new</b> { |item| "I love to eat #{item}!" }</code></li>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now 'food_message' is a saved block, and it can be
        passed in to any method that takes an argument and be used over and over on
        other arrays. The only thing you have to remember is that methods deal with
        blocks, not procs. You need to trick the method into thinking it is dealing
        with a block, and not your new proc. You do this simply by preceeding your
        proc with the <b>'&'</b> sign. The unsuspecting method never knows the
        difference!</br>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;vegetables.each(<b>&</b>food_message)</code></li>
              <ul>
                <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat asparagus!</code></li>
                <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat green beans!</code></li>
                <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat broccoli!</code></li>
              </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit = ["mangoes", "peaches", "pluots"]</code></li>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit.each(<b>&</b>food_message)</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat mangoes!</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat peaches!</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat pluots!</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly enough you can call a proc directly by
        using the <b>'.call'</b> method. What? Use a method on a proc? Remember, it's
        an object. In the case of this example we can go ahead and use the method on
        the proc and pass it a new item. Look:
        </br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;food_message<b>.call</b>("carrots")</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=>I love to eat carrots!</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now what about lambdas then you say? Well,
        strangely enough a lamdba similar to a proc in many ways. In fact, ouside of
        syntax and a couple behaviors, they are really identical. You can even think
        of a lambda as the shorthand version of a proc (even though it's not all that
        much shorter when you put them side by side). Let's look at this one step at a
        time:</br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lambdas, like procs, are objects. They are defined
        with the keyword <b>lambda</b> followed by a block, like this:</br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>lambda</b> { |parameter| block }</code></li>
        </ul>
        You can also set the lambda to a variable like you can with a proc:
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;grouchy_message = lambda { |item| puts "I hate #{item}!" }</code></li>
        </ul>
        To pass the lambda to a method as an argument, you have to fool the method by
        preceeding it with the <b>'&'</b> sign, just like a Proc:
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;vegetables.each(<b>&</b>grouchy_message)</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=>I hate asparagus!</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=>I hate green beans!</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=>I hate broccoli!</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like a proc, you can call a lambda directly with
        the <b>'.call'</b>method:</br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;grouchy_message<b>.call</b>("okra")</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I hate okra!</code></li>
            </ul>
         </ul>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now comes the fork in the road. There are two places
        where procs and lambdas diverge in how they work. The first fork has to deal
        with the arguments passed to procs and lambdas. A lambda checks the number of
        arguments passed to it. If the number of arguments passed in doesn't match up,
        the lambda throws an error. Take a look:</br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;grouchy_message.call</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> blog_page:172:in `block in (main)': wrong number of arguments (0 for 1) (ArgumentError)</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lambda 'grouchy_message' that we set up earlier is
        expecting an 'item' for it to run. If it doesn't see an 'item' as an argument,
        we get the above error. Here's how it looks to make it work:</br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;grouchy_message.call("okra")</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I hate okra!</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the proc could care less about the
        number of arguments. The proc is going to run either way, becuase it doesn't
        check. Look:</br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;food_message.call</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat  !</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;food_message.call("brussels sprouts")</code></li>
          <ul>
            <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> I love to eat brussels sprouts!</code></li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fork in the road of how these two work has
        to deal with how they treat a return. Remember that when you use 'return' in a
        method definition, once Ruby reads that return, its going to output whatever
        it is told to return and then leave the method, as opposed to a 'puts' that
        will output something and then continue with the method definition. If you
        tell a proc to return something, it is going to evaluate it immediately and
        leave the method definition. While using 'return' the proc is going to assume
        all control and exit the method definition. The lambda on the other hand, is
        going to lay down and let the rest of the method definition run. It will let
        Ruby go ahead and do the its normal thing of evaluating the last line that it
        reads. Check out an example to make sense of it:</br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;def proc_test</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parent_says = <b>Proc.new</b> { return "Eat your veggies so you grow big and strong."}</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parent_says.call</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "I didn't ask how the veggies taste, I told you to eat them!"</code></li>
            </ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;end</code></il></br>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;def lambda_test</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parent_says = <b>lambda</b> { return "Eat your veggies so you grow big and strong."}</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parent_says.call</code></li>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "I didn't ask how the veggies taste, I told you to eat them!"</code></li>
            </ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;end</code></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts proc_test</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=>Eat your veggies so you grow big and strong.</code></li>
            </ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts lambda_test</code></li>
            <ul>
              <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=>I didn't ask how the veggies taste, I told you to eat them!</code></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this explanation of blocks, procs and
        lambdas had shed some light on what they are and how they work. Keep in mind
        that this is just simple introduction into these topics. This was meant to get
        you familiar with the basis of these Ruby concepts so that you can go forth
        and expand your understanding. If you find something really cool, send me an
        email with a link I'd love to check it out. And as always, if you have
        questions or notice something where I have missed some crucial understanding
        in this post, please don't hesitate to contact me.
