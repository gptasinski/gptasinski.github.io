      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say this first, I chose the topic that I
        am struggling with the most. I've found that trying to explain a concept to
        someone else helps me further my understanding and figure things out. That
        said, if there's any point that I make here that's just way off, or if you
        have questions, or maybe just want to bond and chat about the frustrations had
        while digesting this concept, please email me.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then, <br />
        Positioning is controlled by the position property. The position property
        has four values: Absolute, Fixed, Relative and Static. Each one of these
        position properties can be further manipulated with four "offsets": top,
        right, bottom and left. Once the position property is set to absolute, fixed,
        relative or static you can then set one of these "offsets" to tell the element
        to now move a specific distance from its position just so far from the top,
        right botom or left. I think of these "offsets" working like x and y
        coordinates on a graph. You really only need to use one of them at a time,
        effectively giving position specifics to a corner of the element.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it's not as straight forward as that. Each
        position property reacts to those four "offsets" in a specific way.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go through them one by one.<br />
        <strong>STATIC:</strong> static positioning is the one that doesn't listen to
        any of those offsets mentioned above. Static positioning will disable CSS
        positioning, meaning that none of those offests will have an effect, making it
        the one the will rarely ever be used. If you are trying to position an element,
        why use the position property that doesn't listen to CSS positioning?
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ABSOLUTE:</strong> absolute positioning is
        the most straightforward of the four. It will position an element right where
        you tell it to by using any of those offests. I feel particularly comfortable
        with this one because even if you resize the window, an element with absolute
        positioning will stay right where you told it. Elements can overlap each other
        in absolute positioning but you can control their appearance with the z-index.
        Whichever element has the higher z-index will be positioned on top.
        Positioning can get tricky when you need to position an element inside of
        another (its parent element or container block). When you try to do this with
        absolute positioning, the element will be set according to or relative to the
        nearest positioned element. If there happens to be no other element with a set
        position in the document, then the absolutely positioned element will be set
        according to the window. In simple terms if you try to position something
        inside of an element that itself has a position property set, your offsets
        move it in relation to the container element. If that container element has no
        position set that the element is set in relation to the browser window.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>FIXED:</strong> think of using fixed
        positioning as using Super Glue. An element with a fixed position is "stuck"
        to the browser and will stay in place if you scroll through the page, and it
        will overlap the other elements in the page. Fixed works a little like
        absolute in the fact that you can set offsets on
        the element and tell it exactly where to go. In the context of setting a fixed
        element inside of another element, a container block, the fixed element is set
        according to the browser window. Your offets need to be interacting with the
        browser window and not the container element itself. If there is an element
        below your fixed element, you need to set an offset on that element so that it
        isn't covered up by the fixed element. As an example in simpler terms take a
        look at this blog post. The navigation bar at the top is using a fixed element.
        The header below it, with the blog title and date has a top margin of 125px so
        that it is not displayed behind the navigation bar and you are able to read it.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>RELATIVE:</strong> is the position property
        that positions an element relative to its normal position: where it would have
        been without any positioning settings. The offests move the element from where
        it would have been placed, not from the other elements on the page. This
        position property doesn't affect the other elements on the browser, and the
        browser treats them as separate elements. Setting the offsets of a relatively
        positioned element inside of a container block will move the element according
        to where it would have been positioned in the container without those offsets,
        not according to the container itself.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some final notes I have to say that even with a
        better understanding of the position property, I think it's necessary to start
        small. Create the HTML document without positioning elements, and then start
        tweaking the positioning of the top most element, say the container block.
        Move downward through the elements of the document in order as they should be
        placed to avoid frustration. I hope this helped, and please feel free to
        contact me with corrections and questions.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to give a big thank you to Spencer Rohan for
        posting the Dreamweaver Tutorial on how CSS positioning works, as well as the
        people who created it. Until I watched that video I felt as if I were treading
        water with this material and now I feel that I have at least a strong doggie
        paddle.
