      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The material, statistics, data and thought that has
        been put forth by Dr. Claude Steele through his research into the Stereotype
        Threat is astounding. Monumental might be a better word. I never thought about
        this idea before, hell, never even knew it existed. The idea that someone’s
        performance is affected by a fear of confirming a stereotype and theory of
        being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype is powerful and
        shocking. I have found this blog post to be nearly impossible to write because
        of the scope of this concept.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve found myself thinking about past situations in
        my life to try and answer the questions from the guideline for this assignment.
        More often than not I discover myself losing hours of the day considering what
        went on in those situations. What I may have been thinking about another
        individual? How did my thinking affect that individual? What were they
        thinking of me? About themselves? How did this interaction affect the
        situation that we were in?
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic is incredibly large and powerful. The
        stereotype threat is ever present, it reaches across all levels of
        socioeconomic standing, all races, all religions, all groups that feel that
        they can be seen as a group that has some preconceived stereotype about them.
        None of us can escape it, whether we are conscious of its presence or not. I
        feel like I have been asked to look back upon a lifetime of interactions with
        people and quantify not only how I have felt in those situations, but to also
        quantify how other people were affected by what they thought I may have
        perceived about them.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After wrestling over this assignment for a few days,
        I think I would rather have been asked to time box one hour to explain
        Einstein’s Theory of Relativity through producing a working time machine. I
        find it ridiculous to try to sum up this material and if I have seen it in my
        life within an hour’s worth of time, much less a month.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to get at is that yes, I certainly
        identify with the concept of the Stereotype Threat. I can see where I was
        affected by it in past performance and where I embodied it to effect the
        performance of others. I’m sure I asked myself a ton of questions, I’m sure
        anyone else who felt the threat also asked a ton of questions. Whether or not
        we all can identify it, we felt it physically. We would not have been affected
        otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that  I feel there’s no point to
        dwelling on the how the Stereotype Threat may have worked on me and others in
        my past experiences. What matters is how I can deal with the Stereotype Threat
        in the future. How I can keep my performance from being affected by it and how
        I can keep it from affecting others.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easier said than done.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are we supposed to protect everyone from the
        worries they may have or the threats they may feel about how they fit into a
        stereotype that I may or  may not subscribe to? Should all the sharp corners
        that the difficulty of life exposes be rounded down to be safe? Should every
        challenge come with a set of instructions and a solution to check against?
        Should every hard surface be padded so that when you get knocked on your ass
        it doesn’t hurt so bad? What we all need to overcome the stereotype threat and
        to work beyond it is a sense of empowerment: an empowered sense of self and
        identity.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere at some point we all see ourselves as a
        group, maybe even a part of many groups. With many people come many groups and
        many points of view. Humans are competitive by nature and there’s no way to
        stop one group from looking at another in a negative light. Consequently
        there’s no way of one group knowing that they are seen in a negative way by
        others. An individual can be a part of any or all of these groups, but in the
        end the individual is a single being made up from pieces of those groups they
        feel they belong to.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to ramble on about bits and pieces, the
        point is that we need to cultivate the idea of individuality as important
        above all else. An individual may be a member of a certain ethnic group, may
        have a certain skin color, may be of a certain sex or whatever else, but until
        the individual is taught to believe that those traits provide no more bearing
        on their abilities than the color of their hair, they are allowing the
        Stereotype Threat to work its way into their performance. Until we can all be
        empowered as individuals who’s worth is based upon our performance and not our
        membership to a specific group we are going to be chased by the stereotype
        threat. At some point it has to be brought to light that these stereotypes are
        based in bullshit generalizations, so why subscribe to them in the first place?
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really important if someone thinks a mistake
        you made is because of your skin color? Or religious creed? Or sex? In my
        opinion that's their problem. It only is important if you believe in that
        stereotype yourself. The problem lies not with people who may embody a
        stereotype with their actions, but to the people who believe in the stereotype
        in the first place. We error because we are human, not because we have
        genitalia that sticks out or in. We error because we are human, not because
        our skin is dark or light. We error because we are human, not because we
        believe in a sense of the ineffible that someone else doesn’t.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then how to keep my performance from being
        affected by it and how to keep it from affecting others?
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the answer to this question ultimately comes
        through recongition and respect. There has to be a self recognition in who I
        am, where I come from and who I want to become. There has to be a respect for
        the other individuals I encounter; a respect for them, their ideas/opinions,
        and their sense of identity as an indivual. There has to be a recognition of
        each individual and a respect for what they bring to the table, because it's
        ultimately those outside thoughts that teach us about who we are as well as
        who the other individual is. Each viewpoint from an individual is important
        because we could never come up with the same thought ourselves on account of
        the fact that different and very specific pieces of background compose our
        individual beliefs. For a welcoming environment and a reduction, if not
        hopeful abolishment, of the Sterotype Threat this idea of respect and
        recognition must become a constant cycle between myself and others that
        drives growth and development. We all have to learn to recognize that the
        ideas we encounter which lay outside our own individual make up are important
        for just that fact. None of us are going to grow or learn anything new without
        each other to provide an outside influence.
