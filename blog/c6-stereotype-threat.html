    <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

  <section>

    <p>The material, statistics, data and thought that has been put forth by Dr. Claude
      Steele through his research into the Stereotype Threat is astounding. Monumental
      might be a better word. I never thought about this idea before, hell, never even
      knew it existed. The idea that someone’s performance is affected by a fear of
      confirming a stereotype and theory of being viewed through the lens of a negative
      stereotype is powerful and shocking. I have found this blog post to be nearly
      impossible to write because of the scope of this concept.
    </p>

    <p>I’ve found myself thinking about past situations in my life to try and answer the
      questions from the guideline for this assignment. More often than not I discover
      myself losing hours of the day considering what went on in those situations. What I
      may have been thinking about another individual? How did my thinking affect that
      individual? What were they thinking of me? About themselves? How did this
      interaction affect the situation that we were in?
    </p>

    <p>This topic is incredibly large and powerful. The stereotype threat is ever present,
      it reaches across all levels of socioeconomic standing, all races, all religions,
      all groups that feel that they can be seen as a group that has some preconceived
      stereotype about them. None of us can escape it, whether we are conscious of its
      presence or not. I feel like I have been asked to look back upon a lifetime of
      interactions with people and quantify not only how I have felt in those situations,
      but to also quantify how other people were affected by what they thought I may have
      perceived about them.
    </p>

    <p>After wrestling over this assignment for a few days, I think I would rather have
      been asked to time box one hour to explain Einstein’s Theory of Relativity through
      producing a working time machine. I find it ridiculous to try to sum up this
      material and if I have seen it in my life within an hour’s worth of time, much less
      a month.
    </p>

    <p>What I am trying to get at is that yes, I certainly identify with the concept of
      the Stereotype Threat. I can see where I was affected by it in past performance and
      where I embodied it to effect the performance of others. I’m sure I asked myself a
      ton of questions, I’m sure anyone else who felt the threat also asked a ton of
      questions. Whether or not we all can identify it, we felt it physically. We would
      not have been affected otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>The point is that  I feel there’s no point to dwelling on the how the Stereotype
      Threat may have worked on me and others in my past experiences. What matters is how
      I can deal with the Stereotype Threat in the future. How I can keep my performance
      from being affected by it and how I can keep it from affecting others.
    </p>

    <p>
    Easier said than done.
    </p>

    <p>How are we supposed to protect everyone from the worries they may have or the
      threats they may feel about how they fit into a stereotype that I may or  may not
      subscribe to? Should all the sharp corners that the difficulty of life exposes be
      rounded down to be safe? Should every challenge come with a set of instructions and
      a solution to check against? Should every hard surface be padded so that when you
      get knocked on your ass it doesn’t hurt so bad? What we all need to overcome the
      stereotype threat and to work beyond it is a sense of empowerment: an empowered
      sense of self and identity.
    </p>

    <p>Somewhere at some point we all see ourselves as a group, maybe even a part of many
      groups. With many people come many groups and many points of view. Humans are
      competitive by nature and there’s no way to stop one group from looking at another
      in a negative light. Consequently there’s no way of one group knowing that they are
      seen in a negative way by others. An individual can be a part of any or all of
      these groups, but in the end the individual is a single being made up from pieces
      of those groups they feel they belong to.
    </p>

    <p>In order not to ramble on about bits and pieces, the point is that we need to
      cultivate the idea of individuality as important above all else. An individual may
      be a member of a certain ethnic group, may have a certain skin color, may be of a
      certain sex or whatever else, but until the individual is taught to believe that
      those traits provide no more bearing on their abilities than the color of their
      hair, they are allowing the Stereotype Threat to work its way into their
      performance. Until we can all be empowered as individuals who’s worth is based upon
      our performance and not our membership to a specific group we are going to be
      chased by the stereotype threat. At some point it has to be brought to light that
      these stereotypes are based in bullshit generalizations, so why subscribe to
      them in the first place?
    </p>

    <p>Is it really important if someone thinks a mistake you made is because of your
      skin color? Or religious creed? Or sex? In my opinion that's their problem. It only
      is important if you believe in that stereotype yourself. The problem lies not with
      people who may embody a stereotype with their actions, but to the people who
      believe in the stereotype in the first place. We error because we are human, not
      because we have genitalia that sticks out or in. We error because we are human, not
      because our skin is dark or light. We error because we are human, not because we
      believe in a sense of the ineffible that someone else doesn’t.
    </p>

    <p>So then how to keep my performance from being affected by it and how to
     keep it from affecting others?
    </p>

    <p>I think the answer to this question ultimately comes through recongition and
      respect. There has to be a self recognition in who I am, where I come from and who
      I want to become. There has to be a respect for the other individuals I encounter;
      a respect for them, their ideas/opinions, and their sense of identity as an
      indivual. There has to be a recognition of each individual and a respect for what
      they bring to the table, because it's ultimately those outside thoughts that
      teach us about who we are as well as who the other individual is. Each viewpoint
      from an individual is important because we could never come up with the same
      thought ourselves on account of the fact that different and very specific pieces of
      background compose our individual beliefs. For a welcoming environment and a
      reduction, if not hopeful abolishment, of the Sterotype Threat this idea of respect
      and recognition must become a constant cycle between myself and others that drives
      growth and development. We all have to learn to recognize that the ideas we
      encounter which lay outside our own individual make up are important for just that
      fact. None of us are going to grow or learn anything new without each other to
      provide an outside influence.
