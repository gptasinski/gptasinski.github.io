      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I even get in to when or how or why to use
        classes in Ruby, it makes sense to first cover what a class is. The way that I
        see it is that a class is in one sense a group of objects. All strings belong
        to the class 'Strings', all integers belong to the class 'Integers', and
        confusingly enough all classes belong to the class 'Class'. However, it's not
        that simple. Classes are not just containers of objects, like an array or a
        hash, but they are also a blueprint or a template for making new objects that
        belong to that class, so that  you don't have to go back and create each new
        item piece by piece. I could ramble on and on, trying to make sense of all the
        technical vocabulary in terms of one another, but every time I try, it comes
        out in a mumbo-jumbo mess that isn't so clear. So, please indulge me while a
        paint a picture for you.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are a supernatural being. You have just made a
        new world and are sitting in a field of lush grass taking in the view of your
        new creation. You like the look of the rolling hills, the feeling of the sun
        on your face and the wind in your hair. As a feeling of pride and
        accomplishment starts to lull you into a much deserved nap, your daughter
        comes up and taps you on the shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job Daddy", she says. "But why's it so green?
        Don't you like colors?"</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sit up and take a look around, and think to
        yourself, 'shit, she's right'. As exhausted as you are, you know you're never
        going to get that nap until she sees some color, so you ask her how she thinks
        you should put some color into this new world. "Well, I like flowers", she
        says.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you have a new task. You sit and think about it,
        and as easy as it would be to make one flower and then just copy it over and
        over to fill the landscape, you know that your daughter is going to want more
        than one flower and more than one color. The problem is that you're just so
        tired. The thought of creating flower after flower after flower makes your spine shudder.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly you have an idea. What if you had a
        blueprint for creating flowers? A template that once plugged in with a couple
        different modifiers could make individual flowers? A template (class) that
        could be used over and over to create these flowers (objects), which all share
        certain simliarities but each have their own characteristics? Good thing that
        you've been studying Ruby when you're not busy being a god. So you break out
        your creation computer and open up your trusty text editor. Enter classes:
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you have to build a template (a class) that
        represents the characteristics of a flower and contains the functions that a
        flower is going to experience in the course of its life. You know from your
        studies that you have define your class with the keyword <b>class</b> followed
        by the name of your class written in <b>CamelCase</b>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class Flowers<li>
        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end</li></code>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You now have your template, but it is empty. You
        could go ahead and create a new flower but it wouldn't do anything. It has no
        functions (methods) and there is nothing that distinguishes what that flower
        is. You think about it and realize that all the objects you are going to
        create have a set of characteristics: 'number of petals' and 'petal color'.
        But those characteristics are going to change from flower to flower. Enter
        the <b>initialize</b> method. Think of this as a starter method. Each time you
        create an instance of your class, a new flower, this method will run and
        basically set up your new flower. You can define this method so that every time
        you create a new flower, you pass in these characteristics so that each
        flower you create has its own characteristics.
      </p>

      <ul><code>
        <li><code>&nbsp;class Flowers</code></li>
          <ul>
            <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(petal_num, petal_color)</code></li>
            <ul>
            <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@petal_num = petal_num</code></li>
            <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@petal_color = petal_color</code></li>
            <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "You made a flower with #{petal_num} #{petal_color} petals."</code></li>
            </ul>
            <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end</code></li>
          </ul>
        <li><code>&nbsp;end</code></li>
      </code></ul>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now outside of the class you can pick a name for a
        flower and set it equal to Flowers.new(), and inside of the parenthesis put
        how many petals you want it to have and what color to make those petals: </p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new_flower = Flowers.new(5, "blue")</code>
          <li>
        <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> "You made a flower with 5 blue petals."</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have created a new flower. That flower is an
        instance of the Flowers class. Now that you have started a template, you can
        create more flowers, more instances of the Flowers class with different
        numbers of petals of different colors.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a supernatural being you foresee your daughter
        complaining that the flower really doesn't do anything. Luckily, now that you
        have a class Flowers you can add functions (methods) into the class that
        affect any instance that you decide to create. Let's say that you want a new
        flower to bloom:</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You open your class back up and define a method within
        it:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;def bloom(flower_name)</code> </li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "The petals have opened and
            #{flower_name} is in bloom!"</code></li>
        </ul>
        <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;end</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the above code you have just created a method
        that will work on each new flower, each new instance of the Flowers class. To
        make it work on a new instance, call the method on the instance with the
        flower's name in the parenthesis:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;tulip = Flowers.new(8, "pink")</code><li>
        <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> "You made a flower with 8 pink petals."</code></li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;tulip.bloom("tulip")</code></li>
        <li><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#=> "The petals have opened and tulip is in bloom!"</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now taking this template for creating flowers, you
        can create as many flowers as you want. You can give them all different
        numbers of petals and colors of petals. All of the flowers created can 'bloom'
        as well. You can add more methods to the Flowers class so that the instances
        created can grow, wilt or blow in the breeze. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of this, and the beauty of it all, is that
        you don't have to go and create each new object from scratch. Just go back to
        your template and plug in the specific characteristics you'd like it to have,
        and let the template to the work. Each time your daughter comes up and tells
        you that she wants a new flower, all you have to ask is what color petals and
        how many petals? Then you will truely be a god, at least in your daughter's eyes.
