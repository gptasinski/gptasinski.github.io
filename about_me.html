    <article>
      <p>So then,</p>
      <p>I currently live with my little family in Chicago's Ukrainian Village in
        a great apartment, and outside of the parking situation becoming more similar
        to the Wriggleyville area each day, I really love it.
      <p>
      <p>I grew up in the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago, in what I like to refer to as
        the "Greater Woodfield Area". I have nearly two full handfulls of brothers
        and sisters, but being all steps and halves we all grew up in different houses
        with different people at very different times. That said we all get along and
        love each other just the same.
      </p>
      <p>Years ago I went to the University of Oregon planning to study architecture
        and industrial design, until I realized I didn't want to live so far away from
        my family and moved back to Chicago. It was UIC next, and the move to
        Mechanical Engineering, until three years later I realized I didn't want to be
        an engineer. Some years later I finished a degree in Germanic Studies, with
        concentrations in literature and philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>I like to read and draw. I find foreign languages fascinating and am trying
        to learn more than I really have time for. I also find myself to be happiest
        when standing in the kitchen cooking for friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>Dare I say it, but I've spent nearly twenty years working in the restaurant
        industry. I've cooked, bartended, served, managed, hosted, you name it. Over
        the years I have cultured an affinity for wines and spirits and foods that
        I unfortunately can't afford...<br />
        Strangely it took me all that time, as well as the birth of my daughter, to
        realize that I didn't really want to work in restaurants and now I've taken
        a big leap of faith.
      </p>
      <p>That leap has been into the hands and guidance of the fine folks at Dev
      Bootcamp in Chicago. I got turned on to programming and have since really found
      myself wanting to delve deeper and deeper in. I am completely new to the
      world of programming and so far am finding it a pretty awesome adventure. There's
      still a long way to go and I am looking forward to it all.
    </p>
