    <article>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So then,I grew up in the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago, in what I
        like to refer to as the "Greater Woodfield Area". I have nearly two full
        handfulls of brothers and sisters, but being all steps and halves we all grew
        up in different houses with different people at very different times.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago I went to the University of Oregon planning to study
        architecture and industrial design, until I realized I didn't want to live so
        far away from my family and moved back to Chicago. It was UIC next, and the
        move to Mechanical Engineering, until three years later I realized I didn't
        want to be an engineer. Some years later I finished a degree in Germanic
        Studies, with concentrations in literature and philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to read and draw. I find foreign languages fascinating and
        am trying to learn more than I really have time for. I also find myself to be
        happiest when standing in the kitchen cooking for friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare I say it, but I've spent nearly twenty years working in the
        restaurant industry. I've cooked, bartended, served, managed, hosted, you name
        it. Over the years I have cultured an affinity for wines and spirits and foods
        that I unfortunately can't afford...<br />
        Strangely it took me all that time, as well as the birth of my daughter, to
        realize that I didn't really want to work in restaurants and now I've taken
        a big leap of faith.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;That leap has been into the hands and guidance of the fine folks
        at Dev Bootcamp in Chicago. I got turned on to programming and have since
        really found myself wanting to delve deeper and deeper in. I am completely new
        to the world of programming and so far am finding it a pretty awesome adventure.
        There's still a long way to go and I am looking forward to it all.
    </p>
